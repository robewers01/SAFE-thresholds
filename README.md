data.zip contains all the raw data
thresholds_analysis.r contains all code needed to recreate the values presented in the MS
thresholds_figures.r contains all code needed to reproduce the figures presented in the MS
thresholds_functions.r contains a set of functions generated to support the data analysis and construction of the figures
thresholds_response_to_reviewers.r contains a small set of supporting analyses whose outcomes were reported in the response to reviewers letter

Running all analyses can take a long time, so I have included the results files I generated in the results.zip file.
